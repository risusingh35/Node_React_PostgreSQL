# Node.js Project with Datewise Logging

Creating a well-structured file organization for a large and complex Node.js project is crucial for maintainability and scalability

This Node.js project demonstrates a logging system using `winston`, where logs are stored in a datewise subfolder structure. Each day's logs are organized in a folder named `YYYY-MM-DD`, with log files named after the date. The project also includes mongoDB Database, basic CRUD operations and authentication using JWT.
